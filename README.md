# caster

## Registration

* Register a developer account at [Google Cast SDK Developer Console](https://cast.google.com/publish/#/overview)
* Register your chrome cast device from the Add device menu
* Register a new Styled Media Receiver application

## How this works

There are 2 parts to a Chrome Cast application
1. A sender - the sender is the app that talks to the receiver and tells it what to do.
2. A receiver - the receiver listens to messages from the sender and talks directly with the chromecast.
